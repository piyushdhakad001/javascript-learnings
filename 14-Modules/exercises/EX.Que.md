In the checkout page, the header at the top always says "3 items".

Checkout(3 items)

14a). In checkout.html, find the element that displays "3 items" and delete the text inside. It should display "Checkout ()" when the page loads.


14b). In checkout.js, when the page laods, calculate the actual quantity of products in the cart, and display it in the header: `${quantity} items` 
Hints:
-> In amazon.js, inside the function updateCartQuantity(), we wrote some code to calculate the cart quantity. Reuse this code.
-> In checkout.html, you'll need to add a class to the element so you can select it with the DOM and change the innerHTML.


14c. Continuing from 14b, also calculate and display the quantity in the header when clicking "delete".
-> First, create a function updateCartQuantity() and put the code from 14b inside
-> Run this function when loading the page and when clicking delete (notice that this function doesn't conflict with updateCartQuantity in amazon.js because we're using modules).


14d). If we open the home page (amazon.html) notice the cart quantity in the top-right always starts at 0.
-> Remove the text "0" (so the cart quantity starts as blank)
-> When the page loads, calculate the cart quantity and display it in the top right (reuse the dupdateCartQuantity function).


14e). Inside the function updateCartQuantity, we have some code that calculates the cart quantity (creates a variable, loops through the cart, and adds up all the quantities). Notice this code is repeated in checkout.js and amazon.js.
-> Create a function calculateCartQuantity() and move this code into the funtion so we can reuse it.
-> Put calculateCartQuantity() inside cart.js (because this code relates to the cart) and use export/import to share it between the 2 files.


CHALLENGE EXERCISES :-
We'll make "Update" interactive step-by-step.

14f). In checkout.js, get all the "Update" links from the page and add a "click" event listener to each link. Also, attach the productId to each link. When clicking the link, get the productId and console.log() it.


14g). Add 2 HTML elements after the "Update" link:
-> An <input class="quantity-input"> (for entering a new quantity)
-> A <span class="save-quantity-link">Save<span> (to save the quantity)
-> Style the <input> and set its width to 30px (put the styles in the file: style/pages/checkout/checkout.css)
-> Add the class="link-primary" to the <span>


14h). Make "Save" appear when clicking "Update",
-> When clicking "Update" get the cart-item-container for the product, and add class "is-editing-quantity" to the container (use .classList)
->In checkout.css, style the the <input> & "Save" link and add display: none: (they will be invisible at the start)
-> The CSS ".is-editing-quantity .quantity-input {...}" styles elements with class "quantity-input" inside an element with class="is-editing-quantity"
-> Use this, and "display: initial;" (resets the display property) to make the <input> appear when editing the quantity. Same for the "Save" link
